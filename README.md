FFXIV-Teleport is a simple UI that allows you to save your player position in-game and teleport back to it.

It also has a custom input for X, Y, Z coordinates that you can teleport to. Only use this if you know the coordinates you want to teleport to; otherwise, you might end up outside the map area.

Use at your own riskâ€”there is a possibility of being banned, and I hold no responsibility for your actions.

Currently working for Patch 7.1.1.
